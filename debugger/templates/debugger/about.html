  <p>
    <strong>AI Misfires</strong> is a learning tool designed to help developers debug code generated by AI systems.
    It's a place where you can build confidence in your own understanding by spotting errors that might sneak past even advanced models.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to empower developers — especially those just entering tech — to see that AI is not infallible. You can out-think a model.
    You can spot a bad loop. You can fix what a robot got wrong. And that makes you valuable.
  </p>

    This app was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate skills in:
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>Full stack development with Python & Django</li>
      <li>Front-end engineering with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS</li>
      <li>AI awareness and debugging insight</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
