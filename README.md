## 💡 Why This Project?

As AI tools become more common in coding workflows, it’s easy to forget that they can still produce flawed or unsafe logic. This app is a friendly reminder that:

> "AI is powerful, but your brain is still the most important debugging tool."

Users can run, review, and fix buggy AI code — learning how to spot subtle mistakes and trust their own judgment in the process.
